# 14-years
For 14 years, I've practiced Isshinryu Okinawan Karate alongside school, tennis, and life's demands. Despite challenges, I've remained dedicated, earning a second-degree black belt. Isshinryu's philosophy of respect, humility, and resilience has shaped me on and off the mat, influencing my journey profoundly.
